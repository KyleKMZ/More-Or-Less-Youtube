// Currently implementing three ways to get videos. Each has a equal chance to get selected.
// (1) Getting a random video from a randomly selected top-100 youtuber.
// (2) Getting a random video by using a random word generator.
// (3) Getting a random video from a randomly selected top Google search term.

// Randomly select one of the above three methods and use it to return a video.
