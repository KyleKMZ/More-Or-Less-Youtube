The utils folder has several functions and methods that were used while 
testing and developing the frontend.

It is not actually used in the final build of the frontend, except for some
Axios API objects for Youtube.

However, many of the functions and datasets I developed here are later used
for scraping Youtube data and storing them in a database.

Check src/scraper for the code.
